# Visual Script: The Arrogant Interrogator & The Wanderer

## Phase 1: The Arrogant Interrogator
**Time Span:** `00:00 - 00:08`  
> **Scene Tone:** Gloomy, oppressive, red-black contrast, low-angle perspective.

### 1. Partial Close-up: Dust from the Sole (`00:00 - 00:02`)
* **`[Footwear]`** The shot begins with an extreme close-up of the ground. A pair of black ankle boots steps into the frame; the boot shaft has a matte leather texture. The most striking feature is the soles and thickened heels, which are a high-saturation crimson. The toe box features a distinct split-toe design (resembling Japanese *tabi*), with sharp edge lines.
* **`[Dynamic Interaction]`** The heel stomps heavily onto a rough, grey-green stone pavement. Upon impact, the ground does not kick up ordinary dust but rather stirs up a ring of dark red mist-like energy ripples, which then spreads low across the ground like turbid smoke, hinting at an ominous power carried by the arrival.

### 2. Full Figure: The Red-Clad Uniformed Man (`00:03 - 00:05`)
* **`[Facial Features]`** The camera pans up and zooms out, revealing a slender male figure. His face is completely covered by a pure white hard mask. The mask's surface is smooth and featureless, save for the eye sockets which emit a cold scarlet glow from deep within, lacking any human pupil structure.
* **`[Headwear]`** He wears a black high-crowned top hat with a stiff brim. A bright red long feather is tucked into the left side of the hat, trembling slightly in the wind. A pair of windproof goggles is strapped around the hat band, their metal rims reflecting weak light in the overcast weather.
* **`[Attire Materials]`** He is clad in a heavy red and black color-blocked military greatcoat. The collar features a ring of thick, beige fur, appearing fluffy and luxurious. The chest area is crisscrossed with multiple black leather straps and metal buckles, and a complex tactical pouch hangs at his waist.
* **`[Weapon & Posture]`** His right shoulder bears a long-barreled rifle; the gun body is pitch black, the stock is dark red wood, and the handguard is inlaid with golden metal carvings. With his left hand on his hip, his body weight shifts slightly backward, and his chin tilts up, projecting an attitude of extreme arrogance and insufferable pride.

### 3. Background Figure: The Purple Armored Colossus (`00:06 - 00:08`)
* **`[Physique Contrast]`** Standing to the left rear of the red-clad man is an extremely massive heavy infantryman, whose height is nearly 1.5 times that of the former, his broad shoulders occupying most of the left frame.
* **`[Armor Details]`** He is entirely encased in heavy plate armor interwoven with deep purple and bright silver, featuring broad, spiked pauldrons. He wears a pointed, full-coverage metal helmet, leaving his face in total shadow with no skin exposed.
* **`[Heavy Weaponry]`** He stands resting his hands vertically on a gigantic two-handed warhammer. The hammerhead is hexagonal, and its core pulses with ghostly purple electric arc effects, illuminating the damp surrounding air.

## Phase 2: Silent Contempt and The Thunderous Halt
**Time Span:** `00:09 - 00:22`  
> **Scene Tone:** Extreme stillness vs. motion, massive contrast, collision of cool and warm lighting.

### 1. Character Close-up: The Lad with the Straw Hat (`00:09 - 00:16`)
* **`[Head Close-up]`** The camera cuts to a profile close-up of a young lad.
    * **The Hat:** He wears a colossal, disc-shaped Japanese straw hat. The top of the hat is a deep indigo lacquer, centered with a golden lotus-shaped metal relief. The wide brim extends far outwards, with two thick cyan braided tassels and black ribbons hanging from the ends, swaying gently in the breeze.
    * **Hair & Skin:** Through the shadow of the hat, dark blue-purple short hair with chopped ends and highlights is visible. His skin appears almost sickly pale under the gloomy sky.
* **`[Micro-expressions & Demeanor]`** His eyes are completely closed, with thick, downward-cast lashes. His facial muscles are in a state of total relaxation; the corners of his mouth neither curve up nor down, displaying an absolute emptiness and indifference. This calmness is not dullness, but a deliberate disregard for the environment (especially the two soldiers behind him).
* **`[Attire & Accessories]`** He wears loose clothing dominated by white tones, featuring wide sleeves in the style of traditional Japanese robes, with exquisite dark patterns on the fabric. A golden ring-shaped ornament hangs around his neck.
* **`[The Finishing Touch]`** Nestled in the folds of the fabric on his left shoulder sits a round little bird (yellow back, white belly). It tucks its head in, merging with the lad's currently statue-like stillness.

### 2. Dynamic Outburst: The Thunder Hammer Swing (`00:17 - 00:19`)
* **`[Action Breakdown]`** The camera cuts back to the heavy infantryman. The purple armored colossus suddenly exerts force, using the torque of his waist to drive his arms, hoisting the heavy thunder-element warhammer high and swinging it violently to the right.
* **`[Visual Effects]`** The screen is instantly filled with intense motion blur. Deep purple electric light effects drag out a fan-shaped afterimage in the air, and distortion ripples caused by energy overload seem visible in the atmosphere.

### 3. Freeze Frame: A Hair's Breadth (`00:20 - 00:22`)
* **`[Composition]`** The right third of the frame is dominated by the massive purple hammerhead. The sharp metal edges of the hammer are clearly visible, and the purple light at its core flashes violently, casting an eerie purple hue over the lad's profile.
* **`[Extreme Proximity]`** The warhammer comes to a sudden, hard stop mere centimeters from the edge of the lad's hat. The wind pressure seems to rustle the lad's tassels, but the physical object makes no contact.
* **`[Ultimate Contrast]`** * **Motion vs. Stillness:** On the right is berserk purple energy and a massive metal weapon; on the left is the slender frame of the white-clad lad.
    * **Reaction:** Even in the face of such an imminent threat of a heavy blow, the lad maintains his posture, standing sideways with eyes closed. His eyelids do not twitch, his body does not flinch, and even the rhythm of his breathing remains unchanged. The bird that was on his shoulder has vanished (startled away), but the only living being remaining—this lad—interprets ultimate contempt through completely motionless body language.
