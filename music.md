### AI Music Prompt: The Wanderer's Monologue

**Song Title:** 
Ashes and Wind

**Style Tags:**
Asian Glitch Hop, Traditional Japanese Instruments, Shakuhachi, Koto, Electronic Pop, Atmospheric Drum and Bass, Melancholic, Ethereal, Sharp Male Vocals, Whispering, Bell sounds

**Lyrics Description:**
A song about a puppet who cut his own strings. The verses describe three betrayals and a hollow heart made of ashes. The pre-chorus builds tension with the sound of a silver bell ringing in the void. The chorus is explosive and liberating, singing about being reborn in the wind, having no need for a master or a god, and looking down on the world with a sneer. The tone is arrogant, lonely, yet free.
